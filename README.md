# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification

This is the competition held by Kaggle in 2020.

We would like to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. 

Using the latest image recognition model "EfficientNet" at that time, we succeeded in achieving an accuracy of 86%.
This repository publishes the code.
